No, not *that* kind of &#8220;all the way&#8221; (although we like the way you think /wink) but all the way as in, you&#8217;d want go all the way in providing the best for your loved ones. The best food, the best presents, the best personally-made app&#8230; you name it.</p>
<p>This is why we have decided to push Hackweekend 3: Make Apps, Not War to a different date in the near future, so we can have a bigger, better Hackweekend with more hackers, more ideas and more apps. Simply saying, we want to go all the way to make sure the upcoming Hackweekend leaves your toes tingling till the next quarter.</p>
<p>We apologise in advance for the broken hearts. Wipe your tears and blast those Christina Perri songs, but please don&#8217;t die every day while you wait for us&#8230; not only is that physically impossible, but we would also like our lovelorn hackers to be alive to code their hearts out. We&#8217;ll let you know when the new dates will be &#8211; till then, we hope we can still be friends.</p>

<p>Hackweekend 2 was an excellent event; I am really proud Experian had the opportunity to support it. Hackweekend represents an approach to development that resonates with me. Set a short timeframe, decide what&#8217;s important and deliver something people can use and provide feedback on so you can iterate and create the best possible product.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a new opportunity to develop your career and work with talented &#8216;getting it done&#8217; sort of people then this may be of interest.</p>
<p>There is currently an opportunity to work on a new product that has recently joined the Experian fold; AlchemySocial &#8211; a social media ad management platform which provides fine control over placing ads on Facebook and other social sites.</p>
<p>AlchemySocial is a feature-rich, multi-tier web application written in PHP and leverages Zend Framework. This product comes from a recent acquisition by Experian, TechLightenment, a successful UK-based company with a suite of social marketing products. The new team will be working closely with the Experian Hitwise team and the UK TechLightenment team.</p>
<p>Senior, mid-level or fresh graduate all welcome to apply &#8211; your team mates will be very talented individuals like you and chosen because of their ability to write great software in a team environment.</p>
<p>As with all Experian positions, these roles are at competitive salaries and include a comprehensive benefits package.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://hack.weekend.my/2011/12/19/epic-alt-space-is-epic/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=epic-alt-space-is-epic"><![CDATA[<p>Although the title itself is enough to depict how epic Alt.Space was, especially during Hackweekend being able to accommodate 60 plus odd people and programmers, we thought a full blog post is in order.</p>
<div id="attachment_243" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 632px"><a href="http://hack.weekend.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/378020_254770321250430_168750623185734_688575_452133165_n.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-236];player=img;"><img class="size-full wp-image-243   " title="378020_254770321250430_168750623185734_688575_452133165_n" src="http://hack.weekend.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/378020_254770321250430_168750623185734_688575_452133165_n.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="413" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Where it all happened</p></div>
<p>Staying true to its name, Alt.Space is definitely a great alternate space for you to spend your afternoons doing work or building things (most probably software, we&#8217;re not too sure how the two Nicoles would feel about a bunch of woodcutters in their space) if you&#8217;re looking for a change of scenery to have your business discussions, meetings, study sessions, coding sessions, or even as an office space, if you&#8217;re just starting out and can&#8217;t afford to rent a proper office and also can&#8217;t get work done at home because the ambience just isn&#8217;t right.</p>
<p>At Alt.Space, the ambience is the very epitome of &#8220;just right&#8221;, even Goldilocks would wander in, settle down and start coding, if she knew how to code. The music is soothing, at the right volume and takes away the homocidal thoughts you just had about that client who wanted yet another design change. The space itself is very warm and raw, with wooden tables and benches, cemented floors and walls that gives off a slightly unfinished look, with witty posters they have on these walls that add even more character to the space.</p>
<div id="attachment_244" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 607px"><a href="http://hack.weekend.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/333212_254200481307414_168750623185734_687395_1396691061_o.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-236];player=img;"><img class="size-full wp-image-244    " title="333212_254200481307414_168750623185734_687395_1396691061_o" src="http://hack.weekend.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/333212_254200481307414_168750623185734_687395_1396691061_o.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="446" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alt.Space sans hackers</p></div>
<p>If the ambience isn&#8217;t enough, Alt.Space also makes a pretty mean drink! And by mean we mean great. Their lattes, cappuccinos, and smoothies would be a good enough reason to want to rent out a table for a month, until you get sick of drinking delicious smoothies and cappuccinos (which will probably never happen. Those Nicoles know how to get you hooked so you never want to leave).</p>
<p>And to add to already glowing review, they sponsored the cozy space you worked in during Hackweekend &#8211; staying till late taking your coffee orders and coming in all fresh and bubbly in the morning to make sure you were fresh and bubbly for the upcoming demos.</p>
<div id="attachment_247" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 632px"><a href="http://hack.weekend.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/377266_254659621261500_168750623185734_688471_1703338211_n-1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-236];player=img;"><img class="size-full wp-image-247   " title="377266_254659621261500_168750623185734_688471_1703338211_n (1)" src="http://hack.weekend.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/377266_254659621261500_168750623185734_688471_1703338211_n-1.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="415" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alt.Space with hackers</p></div>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not epic enough, the owners of Alt.Space agreed to throw in more sponsorship and gave the winner of Hackweekend&#8217;s People&#8217;s Choice Award a table for the team to work on their winning project! This prize went to Shafiu, the team behind Taxi Watch, a crowd-sourced app that works via SMS and web to check a taxi&#8217;s level of dodginess, and they get a table for the whole team for two weeks, where they get a special table with a plaque, and drinks and snacks. For two weeks. Anyone interested in joining team Taxi Watch can sign up here. Just kidding. But seriously though.</p>
<p>All in all, Alt.Space was PERFECT for Hackweekend 2. Alt.Space? More like, AWESOME Space!</p>

<p>Hackweekend 2 kicked off with a blast at 12pm at the wonderfully cozy Alt.Space at Jaya One.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Hackweekend 2" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/383063_254769777917151_168750623185734_688557_1928904034_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="382" /></p>
<p>Hackweekenders arrived, got settled down and were fed (and hooked up to YES4G &#8211; the silent superheroes of Hackweekend 2 so far!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Nutrition" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/374944_254659387928190_168750623185734_688459_924019743_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></p>
<p>By 2pm, the hunger appeased hackweekenders gathered to listen to keynote speakers spread the Hackweekend word. It was well received.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Hackweekenders" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/379091_254769917917137_168750623185734_688561_1340991905_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="382" /></p>
<p>Our amazing sponsors had their say too. Just before everyone begun the slow descent into drowsiness, they were aroused to come forward and share ideas they wanted to hack on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/374286_254770217917107_168750623185734_688572_283532110_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="382" /></p>
<p>They came and shared in droves. To connect potential teammates, ideas were put up for vote with each hackweekender having a limited number of votes to give out. Teams formed organically and broke-off to set up base and begin to hack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/377229_255005021226960_168750623185734_689142_963761506_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></p>
<p>Hacking proceded in varying levels of intensity almost uninterrupted but for the quiet call to inform potentially hungry hackweekenders that more food had arrived for tea, until 7pm. Hackweekend stepped it up a notch at 7pm, by serving the best live acoustic guitar performance at a hackathon ever (EVER!!!11) courtesy of the amazing Az Samad (who is performing Tuesday night at No Black Tie with his Trio) ! Diner was served and some multitasking-hackweekenders enjoyed the flawless renditions while chowing down dinner (and ABC for desert).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/389963_255004707893658_168750623185734_689130_626828532_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></p>
<p>Hacking resumed soon after, again uninterrupted but for the quiet call announcing that the Shisha (courtesy of Says.my) had arrived and interested hackweekenders could enjoy a few puffs outside to mellow out and solve difficult problems with their subconscious. Shisha <del>was</del> is awesome. Brogramming is better!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/376428_255005194560276_168750623185734_689150_365634535_n.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="384" /></p>
<p>At one point, even the stars aligned to bless Hackweekend with a celestial event. Hackweekend 2 : Red Moon Edition.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/383989_255005094560286_168750623185734_689145_1390382124_n.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" /></p>
<p>At 12am hackweekenders made it to the first checkpoint and had to be dragged kicking and screaming off their machines to share their progress with the rest and seek solutions to any problems they were facing. We were all blown away by the quality of ideas and teams and the progress they demonstrated already. It left us licking our lips in anticipation of the demo session to come. (There was more food, of course!)</p>
<p>Hacking resumed soon after as hackweekenders approached the zone and were getting more wired-in for the crucial development push.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/376516_255005214560274_168750623185734_689151_1691525251_n.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" /></p>
<p>Its 4.24AM. T-5.5 hours to demos. Eyes feeling heavy. Must not give in (for there are cream puffs and they are GOOD).</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>What to pack</h2>
<p><strong>Your machine</strong> but also remember that it&#8217;s the small things that make it work. Power cables, mice, your favourite pair of headphones and if you really need it perhaps an additional monitor.</p>
<p><strong>Comfy wear</strong> cause you are going to be in it for a little more than 24 hours and we all know there is nothing worse than being stuck in something stuffy. Slippers, shorts and a tees are perfectly acceptable. It gets cold later at night so you might want to pack a sweater or a travel blanket.</p>
<p><strong>Toiletries</strong> come in handy for overnight hacking. Leave the soap and shampoo at home and consider packing a tooth brush and some tooth paste. Maybe a facial cleanser and a small towel at most but we think packing light in this department is the order of the day as there won&#8217;t be shower spaces provided anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Medication</strong> for those of you that have preexisting medical conditions. If there is something that the organizers need to look out for please give us a heads up.</p>
<p><strong>Connection tools</strong> should be packed too as you will be meeting a lot of new people, name cards will come in handy, you could alternatively sign up for http://radd.me the contact sharing application and save some trees<br /> What to prepare for</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The pitch</h2>
<p>Be clear about what you want to hack, the more clear you are the easier it is for people to join your team and move on to make amazing things. Consider framing your “pitch” to the following format :</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the problem i seek to solve</li>
<li>My idea on how to solve it</li>
<li>What existing talents/ assets I have that would help me do it</li>
</ol>
<p>Each person is given precisely 60 seconds to pitch an idea at the beginning of hackweekend, no slides just get up on stage and make your case. If you already have a team &#8211; you get to go first. Come speak to the organizers if you need to run through your pitch and get comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Then people pick teams they would like to join and hacking starts.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Your Hack</h2>
<p>If you spend time looking for the assets that are required to build such as an existing code base that you can fork or creative commons images for that you can use. If you have the time you can already start mocking up your ideas. If you aren&#8217;t using your regular machines it is advisable that you prep your development environment loading up your favorite text editors and FTP clients and such.</p>
<p>Some great resources<br /> 10 Completely Free Wireframing and Mockup Tools <a href="http://bit.ly/vT53kC">http://bit.ly/vT53kC</a><br /> Images : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/</a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Starting on the right foot</h2>
<p>Make sure to be clear with the rest of the group what are your intentions for the weekend.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am here to build something to moneytize and make millions of monies from , this means after the weekend you are going to want to be involved in this project actively (career change kinda active) and have a stake in this project.</li>
<li>I am here to have a little bit of fun and build something cool, as long as I am credited as having helped build it I will be happy, not too interested in getting involved after the weekend. May help if i have the time but if you guys want to go ahead with it you have my blessing/ approval.</li>
<li>I am here to build something that is to be made open source and it is my intent that all my work is made freely available to the community based on (Insert appropriate licencing here)</li>
</ol>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>Trough out the 24 hours that you are at the hackathon, the following will be provided for</p>
<ol>
<li>Food and drink, with lots of snacks. There might even be beer</li>
<li>Internet connectivity (best effort basis). Bringing a backup wont be a bad thing</li>
<li>Lots of power sockets</li>
<li>A chance to meet and work with lots of amazing people</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="alignleft" title="Airasia" src="http://www.seeklogo.com/images/A/Air_Asia-logo-5ACDC17858-seeklogo.com.gif" alt="" width="200" height="200" />AirAsia is sponsoring a challenge for Hackweekend 2: Finally, Getting it Done around increasing efficiency or improving the customer experience. The winner of this challenge stands to get RM 2,500 from AirAsia. You will be provided special tools / APIs you can use in this challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong><br /> We want to make getting somewhere as easy as possible and cost effective. We are always trying to reduce our overhead and make things easier for customers (e.g. enabling mobile booking &amp; check-in, self check-in, web booking).</p>
<p>Efficiency Ideas: take all passenger information from a central database and make it available to all customer facing agents so they can update details on any platform, improve product selection for in-flight products.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Experience:</strong><br /> There is a series of actions a customer will go through in deciding to take a trip and what to do on that trip (Ref : 5 stages of travel <a href="http://bit.ly/s4XxyL">http://bit.ly/s4XxyL</a>). How can we improve the overall experience or the experience at any given stage? How can AirAsia better leverage its others products and services, such as AirAsia megastore, AirAsia RedTix to create a better experience?</p>
<p>We would like to help customers:<br /> 1) know what to do when they land somewhere<br /> 2) help them decide where to go</p>
<p>Customer Experience Ideas: leveraging location-based services groups (e.g. <a href="http://foursquare.com">4square</a>, <a href="http://koprol.com">koprol</a>), short messaging (<a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>), Deals (<a href="http://groupon.my">GroupOn</a>) and free travel guides (<a href="http://wikitravel.com">wiki travel</a>) to give users a guide of great places to see and what people are doing, integrate services on <a href="http://AirAsia.com">AirAsia.com</a> to help destination selling to users in a helpful way.</p>
